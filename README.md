# Computer Vision Projects 

This repository is my personal learning journey in **Computer Vision and Deep Learning**.  
I’m building small projects step by step to strengthen my skills and share practical examples that show how machines can “see” and understand images.

## Projects

### 1. Blur Detection (Day 1)  
This is a simple project where I taught the computer how to **tell if a photo is blurry or clear**.  
It uses a method from OpenCV that looks at the tiny details (edges) in the image.  

- If the image has lots of fine details → it’s considered **Sharp**  
- If the details are missing (like when a photo is out of focus) → it’s considered **Blurry**  

**Example results:**  
- `sharp.png` → Clear photo  
- `blur.png` → Blurry photo
